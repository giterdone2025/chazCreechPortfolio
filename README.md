# Portfolio Website

## The Objective

Design and develop a portfolio website which is simple
enough for viewers to see my whole gallery of UX and
front-end development work such as projects for
a certification program, projects for a client, and
projects made simply for fun. This website is a
way to brand myself to the whole world for the people to
know all my skills for any kind of software design
combined with development.

## Requirements

Design the portfolio website using Figma in a way
that responds to a few different screen sizes by
restructuring the layout of the content. This project
requires the utilization of HTML and CSS including a
little bit of JavaScript for any complex interactive
elements. Additionally, I need to choose a color
scheme for the sake of the attractiveness of the site.
The appearance of the website will draw inspiration
from the [portfolio website of Penny Banks](https://pennybanks.com/).
As I write the HTML/CSS/JavaScript files, I need to
utilize GitHub to commit changes to the files in the
repo.

### Macbook Pro

For the screen size of a Macbook Pro, I used a lot of
grid layouts to organize the content of the pages in
the most attractive way for users. In this type of device,
including other desktops, the header consisting the nav bar
is placed on the left side of website.

### iPhone 16 Pro

For the other screen size, the iPhone 16 Pro or any other
smart phone device, all content in the grid layouts
are organized in a way the content is stacked vertically
except the grid layouts in each project page. The reason I
didn't restructure the content on every project page
because I don't want the users to keep scrolling down the
content on their phones until they might get bored enough to
exit the website. The header and nav bar is placed at the
very top which stretches from left to right. The header would
also become an interactive element revealing the nav bar when
the nav bar icon is clicked for the sake of simplicity.
