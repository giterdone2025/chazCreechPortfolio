      <p>I started my career path in Sophomore year of Hardin Valley Academy
        when I was introduced the opportunity to write programs in Javascript.
        In addition, I took an elective the high school offered which is
        called Web Design and, it introduced me to building websites in HTML
        and CSS. Since then, I have a great interest in designing and building
        Web Apps. Scroll down for more information about me.

    <p id="experience-paragraph">
      The first programming language I ever learned is JavaScript. Since
      I learned JavaScript, I picked up learning Web Design, Python, and Java
      which extended through college learning high-level languages like C++
      and C-programming. Now, I have been learning front-end development and
      user-experience design from educational platforms like Codecademy and
      Coursera. I'm looking forward to obtaining two certificates as a Front-End
      Engineer and Google UX Designer.
